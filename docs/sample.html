        <h1>Getting started!</h1>
        <p>The definition of the word “foretime” is “former or past time: the time before present”. With the location data that Google collects from your devices, foretime.io enables you to analyze and visualize the places you’ve visited in the past. Not only does foretime.io give you the ability easily map places you’ve been to, but it lets you export your data as CSV files such that you can do your own analysis of your Google location data.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), Google does not provide an easy way for 3rd parties to access users’ location data, so you can’t just log in to your Google account to get started. Instead, you must export your data through Google Takeout before uploading it here. Simply go to <a href="https://takeout.google.com">takeout.google.com</a> and create a new export of your 'Location History' data. When it's ready, Google will email you.</p>
        <p>To conserve bandwidth and processing power, foretime.io only accepts monthly location data files. Once you've downloaded your location history data and uncompressed it, find the folder called "Semantic Location History". It should be enclosed by folders called "Location History" and "Takeout", respectively. When you're ready to dig into the data, select the type data you want to look at and your preferred output. Then, select the range of dates you're interested in, upload the appropriate monthly .json file from Google Takeout, and hit submit.</p>

    <p class="disclaimer"><span id="privacy">A WORD ON PRIVACY:</span> Files submitted to foretime.io are uploaded to the server it runs on, anonymized, and then loaded a data-sorting program whose memory is wiped after it finishes its tasks. As soon as a file is loaded into our data-sorting program, it no longer needs to be physically stored on the server and it is deleted. Further, .csv files created by foretime.io are sent directly to users and not stored on our servers. Data submitted to foretime.io is not shared with any 3rd party unless a user decides to output their data to a map, in which case it is sent to Google's Maps API.</p>
    <p class="disclaimer">Just because foretime.io does not save or share user data does not necessarily mean it won't fall into the wrong hands. While foretime.io takes steps to ensure the privacy of its users, sharing data over the internet has risks. However, when considering the risks of uploading your data to foretime.io, realize that all data uploaded by foretime.io was already stored and likely sold by Google. And for those who are extremely averse to uploading their location data to whatever shady server foretime.io is running on, an open-source command line version of foretime.io will be available for download soon.</p>
